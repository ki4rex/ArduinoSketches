  Blink

  Turns an LED on for one second, then off for one second, repeatedly.

  Most Arduinos have an on-board LED you can control. On the UNO, MEGA and ZERO
  it is attached to digital pin 13, on MKR1000 on pin 6. LED_BUILTIN is set to
  the correct LED pin independent of which board is used.
  If you want to know what pin the on-board LED is connected to on your Arduino
  model, check the Technical Specs of your board at:

  NOTE 1 from https://the-daily-dabble.com/morse-code-light/
  The three Morse code spacing rules:

  The time gap between dots and dashes is 1 unit of time—or the same length as one dot. // 100 
  The time gap between full letters is 3 units of time—or the same length as one dash.  // 300
  The pause between complete words is 7 units of time.                                  // 700
  
  This is KI4REX's expansion on this example sketch to blink the 8th PIN as an LED pin 
  and signal "This is" AKA "DE" his ham radio callsign "KI4REX" with proper spacing
